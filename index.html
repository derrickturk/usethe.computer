            <p>Oh, R. I can’t tell you why “data scientists” have switched, for the same reason I can’t tell you how Santa’s reindeer achieve lift: I simply don’t believe in them. But, I can tell you why I no longer use R for new projects.</p>

                        POTD: &ldquo;Why Teach Programming Languages?&rdquo;

            <p>We continue our celebration (or perhaps examination) of <a href="https://csedweek.org/">Computer Science Education Week</a> with today’s <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/shivers/papers/why-teach-pl.pdf">POTD</a>.</p>
            <p>Many computer science programs include a course on “programming languages”; these take a lot of different forms, from a broad survey of various popular languages to in-depth studies of semantics and interpreter implementation. In today’s POTD, Shivers argues for the importance of studying programming languages not just to computer science students, but to anyone who wants to understand the modern world.</p>

            <p>This week is <a href="https://csedweek.org/">Computer Science Education Week</a>! It’s an initiative I watch each year with a mix of admiration and dread; I’m dead convinced that our society needs to expose more students to computer science, not fewer; that programming is getting more accessible and relevant, not less; that the only way to build diversity of experience and perspective downstream in industry and academia is to construct education programs that appeal to diverse populations upstream.</p>
            <p>That said, I’m not sure that Barack Obama or a movie star spending an hour writing a Javascript “hello world” program and getting an “I learned code” sticker does much to move that needle. There’s a fundamental tension: we want computer science to be accessible, but it is fundamentally hard: hard like algebra is hard. Everyone takes algebra, and as a society we see the value in teaching every student the power of abstracting from concrete arithmetic to symbolic manipulation. But we don’t, generally, construct flashy multimedia initiatives to get kids to write “y = x + 2” on a sticky note and pretend that’s all there is to it.</p>

            <p>Today’s <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/654d/e896dddeaf5f8b2bc1c633f28ec519c653c7.pdf">POTD</a> is a well-known classic in the genre of “social sciences research that confirms what we’ve always suspected: people are terrible”.</p>

            <p>A recent discussion on the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/57660/57660-6151176938762293248">SPE discussion board</a> inspired me to jot down some thoughts on how a young (or experienced!) petroleum engineer&mdash;or for that matter any other technically skilled non-programmer&mdash;might best engage with &ldquo;learning to code&rdquo;.

            <p>Many clients, friends, acquaintances, and (in the Before Times) strangers in bars have asked me over the years: what do I think about “business intelligence” (BI) tools? These are applications which make it easy, without any custom programming required, to connect to data sources, visualize data, and create interactive analytics and “dashboards”.</p>

            <p>What is object-oriented programming really about? What’s so special about “late binding”? And why do I have to pass <code>self</code> around everywhere in Python? We’ll take a meandering path in today’s post which will try to answer each of these questions, and build our own miniature object system along the way.</p>

            <p>Oh, R. I can’t tell you why “data scientists” have switched, for the same reason I can’t tell you how Santa’s reindeer achieve lift: I simply don’t believe in them. But, I can tell you why I no longer use R for new projects.</p>

            <p>Today’s <a href="https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf">Paper of the Day</a> continues this week’s theme of “education”; this time, with a research mathematician turned educator’s thoughts on why K-12 math education ends up leaving so many graduates with negative feelings toward math.</p>
            <p>I like this paper a lot, because it resonates so strongly with my own experience of middle- and high-school math. I had several great teachers, but somehow it all seemed like an exercise in memorization, at best, or obscurantist puzzle-solving, at worst: a sequence of parlor tricks; when you see this pattern, do this transformation (it’s called “integration by parts”, but you will not be required or encouraged to know where it came from or why it got the name).</p>

            <p>We continue our celebration (or perhaps examination) of <a href="https://csedweek.org/">Computer Science Education Week</a> with today’s <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/shivers/papers/why-teach-pl.pdf">POTD</a>.</p>
            <p>Many computer science programs include a course on “programming languages”; these take a lot of different forms, from a broad survey of various popular languages to in-depth studies of semantics and interpreter implementation. In today’s POTD, Shivers argues for the importance of studying programming languages not just to computer science students, but to anyone who wants to understand the modern world.</p>

            <p>Today’s <a href="https://3e8.org/pub/scheme/doc/lisp-pointers/v6i2/p43-ferguson.pdf">POTD</a> continues our theme of <a href="https://csedweek.org/">Computer Science Education Week</a>. Yesterday we saw a paper (and retraction), and meditated on the topic of why it’s so hard to teach programming.</p>
            <p>What if part of the reason is that the way computer science topics are typically presented just isn’t that interesting to students?</p>

            <p>This week is <a href="https://csedweek.org/">Computer Science Education Week</a>! It’s an initiative I watch each year with a mix of admiration and dread; I’m dead convinced that our society needs to expose more students to computer science, not fewer; that programming is getting more accessible and relevant, not less; that the only way to build diversity of experience and perspective downstream in industry and academia is to construct education programs that appeal to diverse populations upstream.</p>
            <p>That said, I’m not sure that Barack Obama or a movie star spending an hour writing a Javascript “hello world” program and getting an “I learned code” sticker does much to move that needle. There’s a fundamental tension: we want computer science to be accessible, but it is fundamentally hard: hard like algebra is hard. Everyone takes algebra, and as a society we see the value in teaching every student the power of abstracting from concrete arithmetic to symbolic manipulation. But we don’t, generally, construct flashy multimedia initiatives to get kids to write “y = x + 2” on a sticky note and pretend that’s all there is to it.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf">Paper of the Day</a> for today comes to us from the distant past: a time before venture capital firms would seemingly hurl trebuchet-loads of money at anyone with a “.ai” domain name and the ability to spell “deep learning”. (I’ve been working on this long enough that my folder of papers on machine learning and data science is labeled “AI”.)</p>
